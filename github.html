        <p>1.Create a new issue in your repository describing a bug or feature request.</p>
        <p>2.Assign the issue you created to yourself and add a label (e.g., "bug").</p>
        <p>3.Create a milestone called "v1.0 Release" and assign your issue to it.</p>
        <p>4.Open an issue, close it with a comment, and reference a related commit.</p>
        <p>5.Create a project board with columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Add an issue to the "To Do" column.</p>
        <p>6.Create an issue template for your repository for bug reports.</p>
        <p>7.Convert an issue into a discussion, and comment on it with a potential solution.</p>
        <p>8.Filter issues by label and milestone to view only relevant issues.</p>
        <p>9.Move an issue from one project board column to another after completing a task.</p>
